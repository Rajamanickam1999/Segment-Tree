Problem statement :
	You are given a number n and number of queries(q)
	 
	‘n’ ---->Represents the length of the array
	That is for a given n you need to create list of elements initialised with 0
	For example if n = 5
	Then if a=array / list 
	a=[0,0,0,0,0]
	Then you are provided with 2 types of queries
	1st Query ------->	0 p q val
	That is values in the range p to q (both p and q inclusive) must be updated 	to the value “val”
	Example :
		a=[0,0,0,0,0] for n=5 and 
		query=0 0 4 1
		then a=[1,1,1,1,1]
	2nd Query-------->1 p q
	You need to find the sum in the range [p,q] both (p and q inclusive)
	Example :
		a=[1,2,3,4,5]	
		query=1 0 3
		Then the answer is 6 [(1+2+3)]
